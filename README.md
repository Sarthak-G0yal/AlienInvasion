## Development Journey

This is a Classic RetroüïπÔ∏è game that we all have played as a child or some might even be enjoying it right now. I built this game as my first big project using **Python** and its **Pygame** Module.

It was a fun project which helped me learn a lot about the flow of development, code management, refactoring, the importance of descriptive names, and many other things.

I have used [**Python Crash Course By Eric Matthes 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition**](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/) as my guide. It is a very good book to learn Python from, as it focuses more on implementation rather than just the theory. It has many interesting project-based chapters that are fun to do and teach us many concepts.
